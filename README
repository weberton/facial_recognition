This project is a Python-based application that uses face recognition and emotion detection to process video frames. It leverages libraries such as `face_recognition`, `DeepFace`, and `OpenCV`.

## Features
- Detects faces in video frames.
- Analyzes emotions using DeepFace.
- Draws bounding boxes and emotion labels on faces.
- Efficiently processes video by skipping frames while maintaining annotations.
